# ESP3266-irrigation-system
I created frontend application that can run on server both local and cloud. It is used to fetch data from sensors with esp8266 and display on webpage. It contains charts to retrieve sensor data and display them as graph. It is really simple app and is free to use. Perfect for beginners in IoT.
First you should connect your esp8266 to monitor soil moisture and dh11 sensor for humidity and temperature. You can also use any kind of water pump and connect it directly to relay module that is paired with esp8266 microcontroller.
Database is in form of JSON files since we are not dealing with big amount of data, this is only for prototyping. For further isntructions on how to run this app and make it work, contact me on curiousprogrammer00@gmail.com

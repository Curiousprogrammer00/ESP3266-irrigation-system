# ESP3266-irrigation-system
I created frontend application that can run on server both local and cloud. It is used to fetch data from sensors with esp8266 and display on webpage. It contains charts to retrieve sensor data and display them as graph. It is really simple app and is free to use. Perfect for beginners in IoT.
